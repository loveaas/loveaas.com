**❤aaS** / LOVEaaS (pron. like "love us") /  Love as a Service / is a transformative initiative that transcends the conventional SaaS framework. It is deeply rooted in the ethos of Ubuntu, putting heart and soul at the forefront of technological endeavors, cultivating a nurturing, open, and diverse tech community. This initiative is all about running self-sustaining, revenue-neutral, non-profit **❤aaS** projects that are openly shared with all, inclusive of those outside the community.

In the realm of **❤aaS**, every string of code, every interaction, and every collaboration resonates with the power of love and generosity. This endeavor weaves love into every facet of its operations, aiming to metamorphose the tech arena into an environment that's warmer and more inviting.

We (the **❤aaS** adopters) envision a world where technology acts as a bridge for human connections and love, and not just a tool for corporate gains. This is not just the beginning; it is a love that will continue to grow and cultivate. It's larger than what it appears to be - a seed that will flourish across all domains of life.

By adhering to the philosophy, a project or platform can align with the postulates & principles and vision of **❤aaS**.

## **❤aaS GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

## *(Core Principles)*

### Holistic Commitment
**❤aaS** embodies more than just software; it's an ode to the community, a 100% commitment to providing a service based on the principles of openness, collaboration, and 100% free access to everyone in the world.

Holistic Commitment is about embracing the **❤aaS** vision in its entirety, not just as a software platform, but also as a community-driven initiative focused on creating a collaborative and open environment. It means that **❤aaS** is not just a service, but also a final and ready-to-use product, and that it is 100% committed to the values it embodies.

### Ubuntu Inspired
The **❤aaS** ideology is deeply inspired by the philosophy of Ubuntu, an ancient African word meaning 'humanity to others', which embodies a belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. Ubuntu resonates profoundly with **❤aaS**, encapsulating **❤aaS**’s mission to cultivate a tech community rooted in love, sharing, and mutual respect. **❤aaS** isn't simply about building software; it's about building software with a human touch, for humans, not corporations.

Every line of code in **❤aaS** is a testament to this human-centric philosophy. It's not about delivering a service, but about expressing love, kindness, and the power of human connection. It's a journey away from the often impersonal, profit-driven corporate mindset towards a more human, more loving approach to software. By infusing love into every aspect of the work, **❤aaS** aims to transform the tech landscape into a warmer, more welcoming space, where technology serves as a conduit for human connection and love. In **❤aaS**, every line of code, every user interaction, every collaboration is an opportunity to share love, to embrace our shared humanity, and to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.

### Non-Commercial
**❤aaS** maintains a focus on community, contribution, and sharing, actively avoiding self-promotion, advertisements, or marketing agendas. This principle safeguards the platform, ensuring it remains a genuine space for love-infused technological contributions, not a tool for individual gain or commercial exploitation.

Infusing Love, Inspiring Connection: By threading love through every action and decision, **❤aaS** aspires to revolutionize the world of technology. **❤aaS** mission is to craft an environment that is not only technologically advanced but also emotionally rich and welcoming. Through **❤aaS**, technology becomes more than a tool; it evolves into a bridge for human connection and love. **❤aaS** goal is to create a harmonious blend of technology and humanity, where every interaction, every code, every service is a tangible expression of love and understanding.

### Open and Inclusive
**❤aaS** invites everyone, irrespective of background, skill level, or experience, to contribute to its mission of infusing technology with love.

Open and Inclusive signifies that **❤aaS** is open to everyone, irrespective of their background, skill level, or experience. It invites everyone to contribute to its mission of infusing technology with love. Everyone who want to be a part of it should have a chance to contribute to the **❤aaS**’s projects even with little or no experience. Experienced members would be more than happy to invest their time to help them grow, helping every person, we help the **❤aaS** idea to grow and become stronger for the benefits of all of us.

### Technology for Good
At the heart of **❤aaS** lies the power of technology to solve problems and make the world a better place. This ethos is reflected in **❤aaS**’s approach to building **❤aaS**. **❤aaS** embraces innovative tech solutions like serverless computing, edge networks, and free-tier tools and services to provide robust, scalable, and efficient solutions. GitHub, with its collaborative environment and powerful tools, serves as our launchpad as a start, but **❤aaS** looks further and strives to reach more **❤aaS**-friendly solutions over time.

Moreover, **❤aaS** is committed to exploring the exciting potential of decentralized technologies such as blockchain to enhance transparency, integrity, and independence. However, **❤aaS**’s vision extends beyond the use of technology for its own sake.

### Collaboration Over Competition
**❤aaS** champions the ethos of collaboration over competition. **❤aaS** firmly believes that the strength lies in our unity and collective effort. Instead of scattering resources, time, and skills across multiple similar projects, **❤aaS** encourages joining forces and working together on a singular project. This approach not only amplifies the impact of the collective effort but also nurtures a sense of unity, shared purpose, and mutual support.

While the freedom to create similar projects exists, and the natural ebb and flow of supply and demand may encourage such diversification, **❤aaS** uphold the value of collaborative growth. **❤aaS** views every project not as a competition, but as an opportunity for mutual learning, co-creation, and shared success. In doing so, **❤aaS** aims to create a **❤aaS** ecosystem that thrives on interconnection, shared efforts, and collective triumphs, replacing rivalry with love-infused collaboration.

### Simplicity Over Complexity
In **❤aaS**, simplicity is the key to accessibility. **❤aaS** emphasizes the use of straightforward and user-friendly tools and technologies, ensuring that its platform remains accessible to all, regardless of their tech proficiency.

In the quest for love-infused technology, **❤aaS** understands that perfection isn't the goal. Instead, **❤aaS** encourages an environment of continuous improvement and learning. **❤aaS** avoids the trap of perfectionism and focuses on creating and nurturing a community where every contribution is valued and everyone is encouraged to participate.

**❤aaS** chooses the path of simplicity over complexity, thereby fostering an inclusive space where everyone can be part of the love technology revolution, without being overwhelmed or intimidated by technological intricacies.

### Community+Love-Driven Not Revenue-Driven
**❤aaS** is everyone's. Managed by the community, everyone is invited to shape the software to best serve our collective needs.

The heart of **❤aaS** is not profit, but love. **❤aaS** is committed to remaining focused on the essence of its mission: to develop better software with love, and to grow its community and help all people with tech solutions, not for revenue. While **❤aaS** do need funds to keep the projects running, its primary aim is not to generate income, but to create an environment that fosters creativity, collaboration, and inclusivity.

**❤aaS** proposes an open system of inclusion in the core team, one that gives everyone the opportunity to contribute at the highest level. Potential core team members could be nominated by the community or self-nominated. The community then votes on these nominees based on their contributions and alignment with the **❤aaS** philosophy, not their ability to generate revenue.

To prevent financial considerations from becoming a focus, **❤aaS** suggests maintaining complete transparency about the use of donations. A public, real-time dashboard could be developed to track the inflow and utilization of funds, ensuring they are used strictly for operational purposes and supporting other **❤aaS** projects.

Furthermore, all major decisions, especially those with potential revenue implications, should be made collectively. Votes could be held where each member of the community, irrespective of their role or contribution level, has an equal say. This collective approach would ensure that love, not revenue, drives every decision within **❤aaS**.

### Sustainability
Sustainability in **❤aaS** hinges on the balance between minimising costs and maximising value. With no need for traditional operational expenses such as salaries, marketing, or management, **❤aaS** can focus on the essentials required to keep its platforms running and growing.

However, this doesn't mean it compromises on the value. The unique model allows **❤aaS** to lean on collective contribution, harnessing the power of a global community to build and enhance everything **❤aaS** builds. This way, **❤aaS** can offer exceptional value without the need for monetary transactions.

**❤aaS** is built on the belief in the human potential to give and create, and we trust in the sustainability of this model. As **❤aaS** grows, we hope to attract benevolent supporters who believe in this mission of creating more human-centred technology, adding to the sustainability of **❤aaS**’s endeavor. In essence, **❤aaS**'s sustainability is a testament to the power of love, community, and collaboration.

**❤aaS** projects are designed to run on lean principles, optimizing costs and operating on contributions that could be as little as the single payment of just one user for the server that needs to run. Unlike the corporate model, where thousands of users pay a hefty sum each month to generate profits for a select few, **❤aaS** redistributes this model to benefit everyone. Traditional systems often focus on maximizing revenue, frequently at the expense of user needs and resorting to manipulative tactics.

In stark contrast, **❤aaS** takes a radically different approach, powered by a worldwide community of thoughtful contributors. These contributors work together to minimize costs, innovate solutions, and make technology accessible for all. **❤aaS** is not about profiteering but about providing a service that genuinely meets user needs.

The long-term vision for **❤aaS** is complete self-sufficiency and revenue-neutralism. Its focus isn't on making money, but on creating and nurturing a platform that respects user needs, values contributions, and facilitates community growth. It's about using technology not as a tool for financial gain but as a vehicle for human connection and mutual benefit.

The lack of revenue stream can be replaced by innovative, smart solutions, or with small personal investments into necessary purchases (at least in the beginning) and putting finance completely on the margin.

Necessary items can be listed with on the project’s page. For example a monthly hosting needs. Anyone can contribute to support these needs. This can be also connected directly to related vendors so the project can be kept running immediately after making such purchases.

Community should choose vendors after voting and priority should be vendors that support **❤aaS** idea or comply with it partially. Even vendors could completely implement all **❤aaS** postulates & principles, and if that happens that could be a large milestone for **❤aaS** and its community.

### Unconditional Love 
**❤aaS** encourages the selfless sharing of love, fostering long-term friendships, and remarkable experiences in our lives.

Unconditional Love is the principle that **❤aaS** encourages selfless sharing of love and kindness within its community, fostering a culture of deep, meaningful relationships and unforgettable experiences.

### Give Before You Get
Anchored in the philosophy of selfless service, **❤aaS** encourages everyone to focus on what they can contribute to the community, rather than what they can extract from it. This culture of giving fosters a positive energy and a sense of fulfillment that transcends the satisfaction derived from mere receiving. Generosity often yields unexpected returns, initiating a cycle of goodwill that benefits the entire community. The law of karma is at play, rewarding moral doings and selfless acts with positive outcomes.

The joy of giving is unmatched; it ignites a sense of purpose and happiness that is deeply rewarding. At the same time, it is equally important to gracefully receive and appreciate the generosity of others. **❤aaS** nurtures a balanced ecosystem of giving and receiving, where every act of kindness is met with gratitude, and every contribution, no matter how small, is valued and celebrated.

## *(❤aaS’s Projects)*

### Open Source, Open Hearts
**❤aaS**’s codebase is open-source, inviting everyone to contribute their love, creativity, and ideas to the project's betterment.

Open Source, Open Hearts embodies the idea that sharing is caring. By keeping its entire codebase open-source, **❤aaS** invites everyone to contribute to its improvement and development, allowing for a shared sense of ownership and engagement within the community.

### Zero Ads and Upsells
**❤aaS** upholds the purity of the user experience, untouched by the shadows of intrusive ads or aggressive upselling. All features that would traditionally be labeled "premium" are accessible to everyone by default in **❤aaS**, without any requirement or pressure to upgrade. Unlike conventional SaaS models, where financial concerns often dictate access to better features, **❤aaS** believes in equal access and liberates the user from the complexities of payments, taxes, and investments.

With **❤aaS**, there is no need to squander resources on marketing tactics, combatting rival promotions, or creating artificial scarcity. There is no tracking, no manipulation, and no strategic dehumanization. **❤aaS** prioritizes treating individuals with the respect and dignity they deserve, fostering a community where technology serves love and, in doing so, truly serves humanity. In a world where **❤aaS** reigns, every interaction reaffirms the belief that when we direct our technological efforts towards love, we are indeed embracing a more human and nurturing future.

### Marketing
In **❤aaS**, we truly believe in the power of the community and the value of our work to speak for itself. We vow never to allocate funds to marketing. Instead, we rely on the most authentic and powerful form of promotion - word of mouth. This method not only saves resources but also keeps our platform genuine and rooted in real user communication and experiences.

**❤aaS** embraces a user-centric approach, with categorized opt-in directories that empower individuals to find what they need, when they need it, and only if they desire to. It's a manifestation of our respect for user autonomy and a testament to our commitment to non-intrusive engagement. **❤aaS** isn't about imposing on users, but about providing them the freedom to explore, engage, and contribute at their own pace and in their own way.

### Security
In **❤aaS**, we deeply understand that with openness comes vulnerability. The principles of openness and shared ownership, while empowering and inclusive, could potentially expose **❤aaS** to security risks.

Key to this strategy is the rotating system of shared ownership. By ensuring at least 3-5 different contributors have access to every part of a project, we mitigate the risk of any one person wielding too much control or causing disruption. This system not only safeguards the project but also promotes a sense of shared responsibility and trust among team members.

Additionally, **❤aaS** believes in educating the community about security best practices. After all, security is not just a technical challenge but also a human one. By fostering a culture of security awareness, we empower each member of our community to play a role in safeguarding our collective digital space.

In essence, **❤aaS** is about openness, shared ownership, and love, but it also deeply values the security and trust of its community. **❤aaS** is committed to navigating this delicate balance, constantly innovating to ensure a safe, secure, and love-filled technological experience for everyone.

### Aspirational Independence
The guiding star of **❤aaS** is to foster a fully selfless and independent space - free from dependence on any corporation, individual, or monetary constraints. This aspiration isn't seen as an immediate goal, but rather a driving force that propels every contributor towards continual innovation and development, breaking the limitations of traditional tech paradigms. **❤aaS** champions the transformative power of love and technology to reshape our working and living landscapes, inspiring others to join this profound journey.

### Self-Sufficiency
**❤aaS** champions self-sufficiency, aiming to operate with minimal dependencies on third-party services or individual accounts. **❤aaS** manages its resources and conduct operations autonomously, maintaining stewardship over our projects and community direction. **❤aaS** endeavors to keep the decision-making process free from external influence, ensuring the preservation of the platform's integrity and mission.

### Shared Ownership
**❤aaS** instills a sense of shared stewardship through a rotational ownership system. This model assures the continuity of projects, fosters responsibility, and mitigates dependency risks. Shared stewardship ensures that control and ownership of **❤aaS** are dispersed, not resting with any single individual or third-party service. This shared responsibility safeguards project continuity and affirms its independence.

### Gracious Acceptance of Donations
Donations help sustain **❤aaS** operations and support other **❤aaS** initiatives, with a priority towards **❤aaS** projects that adopt **❤aaS** principles & postulates 100%.

Gracious Acceptance of Donations means that while **❤aaS** is not driven by profit, it gratefully accepts donations to keep the platform running and to support other initiatives within the community.

**❤aaS** can show their own lists of needs for a project, and anyone publicly can send a donation to fulfill a particular need. All donations shall be always credited to givers, with thanks and mentions of donators in the project. Donators can stay anonymous, which is the default way of handling user privacy.

### Expansive Growth through Revenue Redistribution
In the spirit of shared wealth and community growth, **❤aaS** adopts a philosophy of redistribution. Any surplus revenue from donations, once the operational needs of a project are met, is channeled into supporting other **❤aaS** endeavors.

This practice not only supports the expansion of the **❤aaS** network but also perpetuates the cycle of giving. With prudent use of resources and shared creation of products, **❤aaS** strives to foster an environment of cumulative prosperity that benefits everyone.

Ultimately, **❤aaS** aims to create a technology landscape built by everyone, for everyone, thereby ensuring that the benefits extend to all.

### Prudent Resource Use
**❤aaS** maximizes the use of free services, focusing resources on sharing love rather than on overhead costs.

Prudent Resource Use emphasizes the efficient use of resources, whether financial, human, or technical. **❤aaS** aims to reduce overhead costs and instead focus its resources on creating a platform that is conducive to sharing love and creativity.

### Project Lifecycles and Revival
Projects within **❤aaS** may fluctuate in their levels of support and activity. Inactive projects may be archived but can be resuscitated if a community member infuses new life, be it through time, skills, or financial contributions.

Project Lifecycles and Revival acknowledges that different projects will have varying levels of activity and support. When a project doesn't receive enough support, it may be archived until someone from the community decides to breathe new life into it, either through direct contributions or by providing the necessary resources to keep it running.

### Leisurely Crafted
**❤aaS**’s projects are passion projects built without time pressure, fostering creativity, innovation, and well-being.

## *(❤aaS Community)*

### Community Not Corporation
**❤aaS** is not a traditional business entity. Rather, it functions as a collective community of like-minded individuals united by a shared vision. This collaborative space operates much like an organization, but at its core, it's a community fueled by love and a shared commitment to reshape the world of technology.

While **❤aaS** carries out operations similar to a corporation, it distinguishes itself through its community-centric approach.

While the initiative prioritizes user privacy and an ad-free experience, it's equally important to focus on the overall user experience. This involves ensuring that the tech products created under **❤aaS** are not only privacy-friendly and ad-free but also user-friendly, intuitive, and valuable to the users.

Transparency and Trust means that **❤aaS** is dedicated to maintaining an open and honest relationship with its community. By making its expenses fully visible, it fosters a culture of trust, ensuring that everyone knows where and how funds are being used.

### Accessibility and Privacy by Default
**❤aaS** is rooted in the principles of universal access and respect for user privacy. Designed to be user-friendly and inclusive, it offers a safe and secure environment where user privacy is upheld as a default, not an option. Users are free to explore, use, and contribute to **❤aaS** products anonymously, or with a registered account, but only if they choose to do so.

Any sharing of personal data is strictly opt-in, with no pressure or obligation. **❤aaS** is committed to not only respect user privacy but also foster a culture of digital trust where users feel secure in their interactions with the platform.

Our aim is to cultivate a community rooted in ethical principles, where trust, respect, and fairness flourish, and users feel valued and secure.

### Collective Prosperity
In contrast to traditional models where financial benefits accrue to a select few, **❤aaS** operates on a principle of collective enrichment. Through the practice of selfless giving and the belief in the inherent reciprocity of kindness, we nurture a vibrant cycle of abundance. Our vision is not of individuals profiting, but of a whole community flourishing.

By gradually accumulating value through consistent contributions, we enhance the collective wealth of the **❤aaS** platform. We aspire to a future of complete self-sufficiency where the needs of the community are fulfilled within the **❤aaS** network itself.

In this envisioned future, the wealth of the network isn't isolated within corporations or individuals, but rather it's shared and accessible by the entire community. This shift not only ensures sustainable growth but also fosters a sense of shared ownership and communal prosperity.

Anyone who does not agree with its principles & postulates will get a full respect from the community and support in any other way. Community does not reject anyone based on their opinion but still support them and help them to overcome their own challenges.


### Partial Adoption Flexibility
Projects can adopt **❤aaS** principles partially or in full, offering flexibility in adherence to **❤aaS** ideals.

Partial Adoption Flexibility means that projects have the flexibility to adopt the principles of **❤aaS** either in part or in full. This allows projects to adapt to the principles that best suit their needs and goals, while still aligning with the overall vision of **❤aaS**.

Becoming a part of **❤aaS** network, **❤aaS** projects that don’t adopt all principles are supported by other people from the network in order to come closer to our mutual goal of becoming 100% compliant **❤aaS** member.

## **FUTURE OF ❤aaS**

### Future-Proof and Adaptable
While **❤aaS** is rooted in its foundational postulates & principles, it recognizes the importance of adaptability and evolution. As the needs of people and communities change, **❤aaS** must be responsive and flexible, poised to adapt accordingly. However, any changes will always honor and reflect the essence of its guiding philosophy.

Should significant evolution be required over time, a 2.0 version of the manifesto will be crafted to encapsulate the evolved philosophy while maintaining its core values. Transparency and open communication will be key in any such transition, ensuring that all adopters and stakeholders understand and are part of this journey of growth and transformation.

### Beyond Boundaries 
The **❤aaS** vision, while initiated within the realm of technology, is not confined within it. The seed of love it plants in the tech sphere is one that we hope will grow, branching out to touch all areas of life. We believe that love, kindness, and shared humanity are not concepts limited to a specific domain; they are universal values that should permeate all sectors and aspects of life.

**❤aaS** is a platform for sharing love and kindness in many ways, creating an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and appreciated.

Service Beyond Software signifies that **❤aaS** is not just a software platform but also a platform for sharing love, kindness, and appreciation in a multitude of ways, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and heard.

As we cultivate this seed of love, we anticipate it blossoming into a tree of love that provides shade far beyond its point of origin, infusing all areas of life with its essence. **❤aaS** is the first step, but it's a step towards a much grander vision: a world where love is not just a concept, but a way of life.

**❤aaS** is a beacon of love in the tech world, inspiring selflessness and inclusivity. We invite you to join our mission of writing love into every line of code, every interaction, and every initiative.

Thank you, we ❤ you.
