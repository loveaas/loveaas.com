Guided by our deeply held belief in love, generosity, and inclusivity, we - ❤aaS adopters, are cultivating a tech
community that breaks
away from traditional models.

Embracing the Ubuntu philosophy of shared humanity, ❤aaS is a nurturing network of selfless, non-profit projects that
transcend boundaries, serving all freely, regardless of community affiliation.

Here, every line of code, every interaction, and every collaboration resonates with the power of love. Join us as we
journey to redefine the tech landscape into a more welcoming, human-focused arena, where technology serves not just as a
tool but as a catalyst for connection, understanding, and, above all, love.

## **FAQS**

initiative to make the tech world a better place for everyone. More human, more inclusive, more loving and more
generous, while still being efficient and productive.

There is no hidden agenda. There is no hidden owner. There is no hidden profit. There is no hidden interest. There is no
hidden anything. Everything is transparent.

### **But who owns the ❤aaS-related accounts?**

Community strives to have no individual ownership of anything. There are some accounts that are needed to run the ❤aaS
network and
the owners of these accounts are the community members who are responsible for the accounts. The sole reason for this is
purely technical, to overcome security challenges. Community votes on the decisions regarding the accounts' assignments
and prefers rotating ownership assignments with multiple members. Anyone can apply for any assignment.

### **Who is the leader of the ❤aaS community?**

There is no leader. The ❤aaS community is a self-organized community. Community members volunteer to do the work and
vote on the decisions.

### **How is ❤aaS governed?**

The ❤aaS community is governed by the ❤aaS Manifesto and driven by the ❤aaS values and principles and the community
doing the whole work.

### **How is ❤aaS funded?**

Since ❤aaS is a non-profit community, it is funded by donations from the community. The ❤aaS community is a self-funded
and it also accepts donations from external sources and supporters.

### **How ❤aaS handles finance?**

The ❤aaS community is a self-organized community and it strives to be completely self-sustainable without any financial
transactions. Financing can be solely made by individuals or legal entities that want to support the idea and purchasing
resources directly with their own accounts for running ❤aaS. The resources can be listed on the ❤aaS website so anyone
can make a direct purchase to fulfill ❤aaS needs.

### **How ❤aaS handles donations?**

The donations are accepted by the community and redistributed to the projects and community or how the investors and
community decide. The donations are accepted in any form, including also, hardware, software, services, etc.

❤aaS strives not to handle any finance itself thus not being a subject to any financial regulations. The owners of the
pieces of ❤aaS resources can be legally bound to individuals or legal entities that want to support the idea and serve the
resources on its behalf, serving as a piece of the whole picture.

Since the ownership is delicate matter, the community strives to have no individual ownerships on anything, find
alternative solutions to solve these challenges, finding solution in the decentralization and blockchain, thus sharing and supporting the idea from the collective mindset which is the end goal.

### **How can I participate in ❤aaS?**

You can join ❤aaS in the development of the network, directory or projects listed in the directory. You can also join
❤aaS by adopting the
❤aaS philosophy in your own projects. If your project adopts 100% all the ❤aaS values and principles, you can apply to
give it away and share your project with the community ande becoming official ❤aaS project. The project will be then
listed here in the official
❤aaS directory.

### **Does ❤aaS have any social accounts?**

No, and it will never have. We don't look for any ways to promote ❤aaS. The only way to promote ❤aaS is by word of
mouth. Users can share more about the ❤aaS philosophy and values and the ❤aaS projects individually with their friends
and colleagues but ❤aaS as a community will never have any social accounts nor will invest any efforts into marketing
itself.

The only exception is the initial Github account, that's needed to run the ❤aaS directory and the ❤aaS network, so it's
not bound to any individual account. The Github account is owned by the community and the community members are
responsible for the account and its content, it's a starting point and it's a subject to change over time.

### **What is loveaas.com?**

This is a website that serves as a directory of all ❤aaS projects. It is also a place where you can learn more about the
❤aaS philosophy and values and be updated on the news in the community. It serves as a starting point for anyone who
wants to join the ❤aaS community, but the community can decide on its destiny or to move it to another domain or to
another place. It is not owned by anyone, it is owned by the community. Any similar projects and directories are
welcomed to join the ❤aaS network.
