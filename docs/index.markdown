Guided by our deeply held belief in love, generosity, and inclusivity, we - **❤aaS** adopters, are cultivating a tech
community that breaks
away from traditional models.

Embracing the [Ubuntu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy){:target="_blank"} of shared humanity, and inspired by SaaS methodology, **❤aaS** is a nurturing network of selfless, non-profit projects that
transcend boundaries, serving all freely, regardless of community affiliation.

Here, every line of code, every interaction, and every collaboration resonates with the power of love. Join us as we
journey to redefine the tech landscape into a more welcoming, human-focused arena, where technology serves not just as a
tool but as a catalyst for connection, understanding, and, above all, love.

hidden anything. Everything is transparent.

### **But who owns the ❤aaS-related accounts?**

Community strives to have no individual ownership of anything. Community can choose to assign some accounts that are needed to run the **❤aaS**
network and the owners of these accounts are the community members who are responsible for the accounts. The sole reason for this is
purely technical, to overcome security challenges. Community votes on the decisions regarding the accounts' assignments
and prefers rotating ownership assignments with multiple members. Anyone can apply to take a responsibility and suggest any improvements in this area.

### **Who is the leader of the ❤aaS community?**

There is no leader. The **❤aaS** community is a self-organized community. Community members volunteer to do the work and

doing the whole work.

and it also accepts donations from external sources and supporters.

### **How ❤aaS handles finance?**

The **❤aaS** community is a self-organized community and it strives to be completely self-sustainable without any financial
transactions. Financing can be solely made by individuals or legal entities that want to support the idea and purchasing
resources directly with their own accounts for running **❤aaS**. The resources can be listed on the **❤aaS** website so anyone
can make a direct purchase to fulfill **❤aaS** needs.

### **How ❤aaS handles donations?**

The donations are accepted by the community and redistributed to the projects and community or how the investors and
community decide. The donations are accepted in any form, including also, hardware, software, services, etc.

**❤aaS** strives not to handle any finance itself thus not being a subject to any financial regulations. The owners of the
pieces of **❤aaS** resources can be legally bound to individuals or legal entities that want to support the idea and serve
the
resources on its behalf, serving as a piece of the whole picture.

Since the ownership is delicate matter, the community strives to have no individual ownerships on anything, find
alternative solutions to solve these challenges, finding solution in the decentralization and blockchain, thus sharing
and supporting the idea from the collective mindset which is the end goal.

### **How can I participate in ❤aaS?**

You can join **❤aaS** in the development of the network, directory or projects listed in the directory. You can also join

give it away and share your project with the community ande becoming official **❤aaS** project. The project will be then
listed here in the official
**❤aaS** directory.

### **Does ❤aaS have any social accounts?**

No, and it will never have. We don't look for any ways to promote **❤aaS**. The only way to promote **❤aaS** is by word of
mouth. Users can share more about the **❤aaS** philosophy and values and the **❤aaS** projects individually with their friends
and colleagues but **❤aaS** as a community will never have any social accounts nor will invest any efforts into marketing
itself.

### **Where is ❤aaS community located?**

The initial place is **❤aaS** Github account since it's needed to run the **❤aaS** directory and the **❤aaS** network, so
it's not bound to any individual account. Future projects can be forked to this account to continue all living in the
same place. The Github account is owned by the community and the community members are
responsible for the account and its content, it's a starting point and it's a subject to change over time.

We can also consider having a community account on some community platform, later. We strive to have a single place for
the community to gather
everyone in the same place if there's a need for it in the future.

### **What is loveaas.com?**

This is a website that serves as a directory of all **❤aaS** projects. It is also a place where you can learn more about the
**❤aaS** philosophy and values and be updated on the news in the community. It serves as a starting point for anyone who
wants to join the **❤aaS** community, but the community can decide on its destiny or to move it to another domain or to
another place. It is not owned by anyone, it is owned by the community. Any similar projects and directories are
welcomed to join the **❤aaS** network.

projects in the service of humanity.
